::: danger
The `@tiptap/extension-document` has been extended to implement a top-level block container, so please pay attention to the compatibility processing of old and new data structures. If you want to see more, please see the [source code](https://github.com/liting-yes/note-editor/blob/main/packages/tiptap-extension-block-container/src/extentDocument.ts).

const editor = new Editor({
  content: '<p>@note-editor/tiptap-extension-unique-id</p>',
